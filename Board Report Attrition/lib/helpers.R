  # roster.match takes a data.table with rosters for a given month-year and
  # returns a data.table with the full roster for the first date and the 
  # students who persist from the orginal roster on each subsequent date; this 
  # funtion is used by KIPP Chicago to calcuate cohort persistnace, i.e., what
  # percentage of students that start in fall 5th grade (on or round October 1)
  # remain each year.
  # Args:
  #   roster: a data.frame or data.table (latter preferred) with PowerSchool ID
  #           (ps.id), name, grade, date, month, year.  ps.id, drade, month, and
  #           year are required fields. 
  # Returns:
  #   A data.table with ps.id for each student in original cohort (by earliest
  #   date) and name, grade, date, month, year data if the student remained on 
  #   subsequent rosters.  If the student dropped off the roster then those 
  #   fields are null.
