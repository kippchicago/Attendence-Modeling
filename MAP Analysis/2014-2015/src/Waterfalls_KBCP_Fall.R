# KBCP October PD daty Waterfall charts

# This one has a wrinkle.

# We need to get spring scores for those that have it, and make them look like spring scores

# So we need to identify which kids have only fall scores from this sesssion and no spring 
# scrores from Spirng 2013-2014).  Select only them from Fall 2014-15, 
#change the term to Spring 2013-2014, and then bind them to the actual Spring 2013-2014.
# hopefully run mapvizier on that one season and feed it to haid_plot. Fingers crossed.
