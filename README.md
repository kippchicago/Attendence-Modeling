# KIPP Chicago Data Analysis 

This repository contains mostly `R` and `SQL` code for importing, managing, analyzing, and visualizing [KIPP Chicago](http://www.kippchicago.org) data.  The repostiory **contains no data** and must never contain any; it only houses the code used to manipulate and analyze sensative student and school wide data.
