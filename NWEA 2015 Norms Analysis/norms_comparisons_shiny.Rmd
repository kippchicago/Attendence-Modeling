```

If you want to get a closer look at any grades just delete any unwanted grades from the input selection for *Grade*.  You can also look at just the 2011 or 2015 norms as well. 

**Have fun!**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("grades", label = "Select Grades", multiple = TRUE,
              choices = c(1,2,3,4,6,7,8), selected = c(1,2,3,4,6,7,8)),
  
  selectInput("norms", label = "Select Norms",
              choices = c(2011, 2015), multiple = TRUE,
              selected = c(2011, 2015))
)

renderPlot(
ggplot(norms %>% filter(Percentile %in% seq(10, 90, by=10),
                        Grade %in% input$grades,
                        Norms %in% input$norms), 
       aes(x = Percentile, y = Student_Growth)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Norms), 
           stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() + 
  facet_grid(Grade~Subject) +
  theme_bw() + 
  ylab("Expected Growth in RIT Points"),
